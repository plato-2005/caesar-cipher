This repository contains a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption technique. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
  Encryption: Convert plaintext into ciphertext by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
  Decryption: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext by shifting letters backward in the alphabet.
  Customizable Shift: Specify any integer value for the shift, allowing for flexible encryption and decryption.
  User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages.
